# Visual mindmap for Hypothesis Testing

A one stop repository to understand on when and how to
perform each of the statistical testing methods.

The mind map covers the below concepts:
1. Definition of Hypothesis Testing
2. Type of Hypothesis
3. Steps involved in performing Hypothesis testing
4. Types of Testing:
    1. Test of Mean:
        1. 1 Sample t-test
        2. 2 Sample t-test
        3. ANOVA
    2. Test of Proportions:
        1. 1 Sample Proportion test
        2. 2 Sample Proportion test
        3. Chi - Square test
        4. Chi - Square Contigency test

The mind map also covers the assumptions required to be
satisfied by the Parametric test and what are the 
Non - Parametric alternative available for each of the parametric test.
